//! Accept payments through a pre-built, Square-hosted checkout page. No frontend required.
//!
//! With the Square Checkout API, your customers can pay for a purchase through a simple, Square-hosted
//! checkout page. It can be integrated into any payments workflow with minimal coding.
//!
//! You can create and configure your checkout page through a CreatePaymentLink request, specifying the
//! accepted payment methods and checkout options like tipping and custom fields. You can also configure a
//! URL for customers to be redirected to once they complete their purchase.
//!
//! First time Square developers should utilize the payment link endpoints to create, update, retrieve, and
//! list checkout pages.
